                       <p>We've been working on a learning platform for children in primary, middle, secondary, and high school students in India. We are currently stakeholders in the application, and are responsible for a substantial portion of platform design decision. The client has given us great liberties with development, allowing us to execute all technology decision with complete trust in our thinking. We are developing the application using Django, AngularJS, and Bootstrap, and explored and ruled out several other frameworks along the way. I've designed and written most of the database myself, and have been working with another full time engineer, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/matt-getz/22/1a0/2ba" target="_blank">Matt Getz</a>, to write and maintain the back end. Before beginning development, I took the time to write extensive documentation using <a href="http://sphinx-doc.org/" target="_blank">Sphinx</a> We've constructed a powerful RESTful API, and a beautiful user interface, featuring support for multiple schools, variable grade levels, compulsory and elective courses, digital assignment and content creation, intelligent gradebook entry, discussion forums, task management, announcements, events and scheduling, a completely hand-crafted administration system, featuring an abstraction principle I developed for this project (ask me about it!). I am the most proud of the work we accomplished here of anything in my life, and I look forward to the day when this system is used throughout schools across all of India. We have great confidence in our clients to make this happen.</p>

                        <p>I am current a technical consultant for a modern fine wine merchant and advisory service, Courtier. I am working with their database to help produce correlations between vineyard inventory and customer preferences. We are achieving groundbreaking results by working with modern software platforms which openly communicate with one another in favor of the legacy software used by most vendors in the industry. I am currently working on developing a data warehouse centered around Zoho, which communicates with other modern SaaS products via Zapier and custom integrations.</p>

                        <p>Youstart.me was a candidate for several European incubators, and is currently funded by a private angel from FinTech. It was developed in Node.js, with MongoDB and Mithril, The project was given to me by an Italian software engineer who I had previously developed a voting application for. He presented the project as a personal venture, asking for help with algorithm design, and ultimately allowing me to take over the application development while he focused on the community surrounding it. I developed features including startup and investor profiles, company creation, voting, a point system, and networking functionality, which prepared both him and his investor for the eyes of the European startup culture.</p>

                        <p>I was asked by a colleague to build a job marketplace for environmental service purchasers and providers. I developed a system, without anything beyond Eloquent, jQuery, and Foudation, which met all of the requiements. The marketplace provides an interface for both roles, allowing purchasers to post projects for which they are currently seeking services, and providers to post services which they currently offer. Both projects and service support categorization and locality classification, each of which is configurable from the administration interface. The search mechanism is AJAX driven and loads results instantly by caching data on the front end. Each result has a listing view.I wrote an internal messaging system for both parties to communicate, and later injected a moderation mechanism to allow administrators to screen all communication from within the system. The project listings allow providers to upload proposals, which are integrated into the messaging system.  </p>

                        <p>One of my very first clients was a marketing directory at Skava. She was after a mobile conversion calculator, which she told me would be able to demonstrate incredible financial gains to many of Skava's higher end clients. I was the third developer on the job - the other two had failed the job. After a month of labor, I was becoming fainthearted. This was my first exposure to Javascript, and neither I nor the client knew exactly what she wanted. It was a lot of guessing, a lot of her cheering me on, and much, much toil, but I got her what she wanted. The calculator speaks for itself, even after two years. </p>
