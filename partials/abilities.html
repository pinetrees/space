                        <p>I left school with a solid understanding of the Python language, and a few personal projects which I had coded in my free time. This experience allowed me to inch my way into the development community, eventually learning and working with each of the languages listed here. I, like many developers, found each to have a character, and unlike many developers, did not have the freedom to decide which ones I used. Having a multitude of clients meant keeping a multitude of languages in my back pocket. With this said, I developed a very strong proficieny with PHP, Python, and Javascript, and was able to use this not only to solve many problems for existing applications, but also to write applications from the ground up for anyone with an idea.</p>

                        <p>I was approached by clients on several occasions to build data driven web applications, handling user profiles, scheduling, payment receipts, and interactive content far beyond the typical blog. Over the years, my experience, comfort level, and intuition of database systems grew tremendously. I developed a strong proficiency with MySQL, and uncovered many optimization techniques which I continue to use in my daily practice.</p>

                        <p>I founded my own web application development company in June, 2013, with my business partner, Ryan Douvlos, in order to see how far we could go. In the two years that followed, we jointly handled finding work, writing proposals, meeting with our clients, learning the languages and frameworks for the work, balancing our finances (this was the most difficult!), developing internal tools, managing projects across a team, and meeting deadlines.</p>

                        <p>I have substantial experience with MySQL, Laravel's Eloquent ORM, Django's ORM, and Rail's Active Record, and considerable exposure to Mongoose and MongoDB. I personally designed the databases for a reservation system, a crowdfunding platform, an environmental marketplace, and a learning management system. The latter includes 125 tables, almost all of which are my design, and all of which I could explain the exact functionality of if put under scrutiny to do so. I've also worked with the database for a journaling application, a real-time sports betting platform, and many complicated WordPress installations. I currently maintain a personal application, Lifebox, which storesa significant portion of my life activities, and which undergoes continual growth.</p>

                        <h2><i class="fa fa-briefcase"></i>Back End Engineering<span class="data"></span></h2>
                        <p>I have written back ends in Python, PHP, and Javascript, many from scratch (in PHP of course), and have found great pleasure in exploring and working with many of the great frameworks, including Django, Laravel, Rails, Node.js, and even Meteor. I have worked extensively with the MVC paradigm, and have development a work flow which facilitates ease of communication, frequent commits, continuous refactoring, and rapid interactive testing, the latter by means of helper classes which do everything from intelligently aliasing commonly used development methods to stashing data in easy to find locations. My work with the back end preceeds my knowledge of framework, and I spent over a thousand hours working with back ends which were not guided by any programming principle (some of which, I admit, were my own). From this experience, I gathered a sizable list of don'ts, many of which have guided my practices more than the do's.</p>

                        <h2><i class="fa fa-briefcase"></i>API Construction<span class="data"></span></h2>
                        <p>A year ago, I was approached by a project manager to program the API for an already developed booking system in Australia. Since then, I have written three success APIs, one of which is currently in development for our learning management system, and has over a hundred endpoints currently available. The majority of the endpoints in use are not simple one-to-one correspondences with models on the back end, but instead unique, hand-crafted endpoints for handling numerous panels on each of the user and academic dashboards across the system. Some of these endpoints are fun, persisting the visibility of panels themselves to the user's account, or adding a simple up-vote to a lesson from a course. Others involve updating entire assignments, complete with questions of up to five types, each with their own storage for choices, word banks, and fill in the blank blocks. Every data transaction, from registering students in the system, creating the classes and courses, and interacting with academic data, is handled through this API.</p>

                        <h2><i class="fa fa-briefcase"></i>Front End Engineer<span class="data"></span></h2>
                        <p>I began writing Javascript a month after I started my business. I had no knowledge of jQuery, let alone libraries like Backbone, Underscore, Ember, or Angular. I wrote a mobile conversion calculator completely in native Javascript before I knew better, and I am very proud of this. Shortly thereafter, I discovered, and latched onto, jQuery. Every project I developed for the next year used jQuery almost exclusively, and I became extremely efficient with it. I developed the front end for a reservation system exclusively with jQuery (later we adopted some Underscore). The system allows for users to create, modify, and view reports for bowling reservations across six lanes throughout the day, and of course across multiple dates. As I began discovering other libraries, I quickly adapted them. We developed the learning management system as a front end application. I originally learned Backbone, RequireJS, and Underscore, and wrote a very successful suite of models, collections, and views which would have worked well, had the application been of a smaller scale, or had the deadline been further away. After understanding this, I adopted AngularJS (and Grunt/Yeoman/Bower/Coffeescript) which I have used to develop features such as task management, discussion forums, messaging, lesson content creation, and a substantial assignment module. </p>
